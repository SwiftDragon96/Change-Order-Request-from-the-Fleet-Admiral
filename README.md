Change Order Request from the Fleet Admiral
The Fleet Admiral has reviewed your program.  He likes what you have done so far but has requested a change order. His request is to add a conditional (if statement) that if the countdown is less than 5 seconds, the message should read “Warning Less than ½ way to launch, time left = insert variable here” .

Otherwise, use the same message you had in the previous program.  Good luck on your mission to improve the UAT Space Program!
